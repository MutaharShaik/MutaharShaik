🌟 About Me

6+ years of professional experience as a Data Engineer & Senior Data Analyst, designing scalable ETL/ELT pipelines, modern data lakes, and analytics platforms. I specialize in GCP, AWS, and Azure Fabrics, and build robust data quality systems, high-performance pipelines using Python, SQL, PySpark, and orchestrators like Airflow & dbt.
I love turning messy data into trusted, high-impact insights, ensuring reliability, scalability, and clear business value.
